This project implements the core components of a basic spreadsheet, allowing users to set and view cell content via a textual interface.

The repository includes:

1. Use cases and domain model (added on 2.10)
2. Domain model implementation in Java (added on 15.10).
3. Core spreadsheet functionality (pushed now as a single batch because I forgot to commit intermediate steps).
   
This latest update includes:
Full implementation of spreadsheet functionality, including saving, loading, formula evaluation, support for ranges, cycle detection, and cell propagation.
Features like displaying the spreadsheet in table format, simple formulas (e.g., =12*4+5), and functions (=MAX(A1:B5, 100)).
